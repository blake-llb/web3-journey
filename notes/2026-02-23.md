The concept of Web3 blockchain has always been rather vague. Taking advantage of the holiday break, I decided to dedicate some time to learning about it. After gaining a basic understanding, I realised many of my previous assumptions were incorrect. For instance, I had mistakenly believed that blockchain was synonymous with Bitcoin transactions. Upon studying the subject, I discovered that Bitcoin transactions are merely one facet of blockchain technology.
The development of blockchain technology is advancing rapidly today, with its scale expanding year by year. I characterise blockchain as a decentralised transaction technology, comprising multiple blocks interconnected through hash encryption algorithms and distributed across numerous distinct computer nodes worldwide. Its purpose is to resolve issues of trust. Originally emerging from Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin algorithm following the financial crisis, it essentially functions as a distributed ledger. All transaction data is stored as a shared ledger across multiple computers, preventing tampering or deletion. This eliminates the centralised failure risks inherent in traditional, single-point storage systems. With blockchain data distributed across numerous nodes, alteration is impossible unless computational power surpasses 51% of all nodes – a scenario deemed theoretically unfeasible. Today, blockchain is being applied across numerous sectors beyond cryptocurrency, including supply chain management, healthcare, education, and banking. The evolution of Web3 represents an irreversible trend within our increasingly complex societal structures.
Blockchain is a decentralised distributed database technology. One might conceive of it as a 'public digital ledger' maintained collectively by all participants. It possesses three core characteristics: decentralisation, immutability, and transparency with traceability. Imagine a village where every resident possesses an identical ledger recording every transaction. When a new transaction occurs, it is broadcast to the entire community for verification. Only after all parties confirm its accuracy do they each record this entry in their own ledger. Consequently, any attempt by an individual to covertly alter their ledger entry becomes invalid, as it would no longer match those held by everyone else. This system of collectively maintained, consistent ledgers resembles blockchain. Blockchain technology initially gained prominence as the underlying technology for Bitcoin, but its applications have now expanded into multiple fields including digital currencies, smart contracts, supply chain management, and digital identity verification.
A complete blockchain system typically comprises the following layers:
1. Data layer, the foundation layer, defining the chained structure of blocks and hash algorithms to ensure data immutability
2. Network layer: Utilises peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols to enable node discovery, connection, and data broadcasting.
3. Consensus layer: The core layer integrating consensus algorithms to coordinate state synchronisation across all network nodes.
4. Contract layer: Provides a programming and execution environment for smart contracts, such as Ethereum's EVM.
5. Application layer: Hosts various decentralised applications (DApps) for end-users, including DeFi, supply chain traceability, and digital identity solutions.
Currently, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of active blockchains worldwide, categorised into public blockchains, private blockchains, and consortium blockchains. Public blockchains are the most active, primarily hosting various investment and speculative transactions by major global investors and institutions. The largest public blockchain is undoubtedly Ethereum. Users conduct transactions either through centralised exchanges (CEX) or directly on-chain via decentralised exchanges (DEX). Building upon Bitcoin's (BTC) development, a multitude of tokens and financial derivatives continue to emerge.
Right then, that's all for today.

web3区块链的概念一直以来都比较模糊，趁着放假有时间决定学习一把，大概了解了下才知道之前好多理解是错误的，比如以为区块链就是比特币交易，学习过后才发现比特币交易只是区块链的一部分。
今天区块链的发展正在快速进行，发展规模逐年壮大，我把区块链归纳为是一种去中心化的交易技术，它有多个区块通过哈希加密算法互相链接而成，发布在全球多个不同的计算机节点上，目的是为了解决信任问题，当然最开始它是由中本聪在金融危机后提出的比特币算法中出现，说白了它就是分布式的数据库，所有的交易数据就是一个账本存储在多台计算上，防止篡改和删除，解决了传统的中心化存储所带了的集中式崩溃风险，区块链数据储存在很多节点上，没有办法进行篡改，除非算力能够达到所有节点51%，理论上是不可能的。今天区块链正在应用在除了加密货币外的其他很多行业，比如供应链上下游、医院、学校、银行等，web3的发展在当今复杂的社会形态中将是一种不可逆的趋势。
区块链是一种去中心化的分布式数据库技术，可以把它想象成一个由所有参与者共同维护的“公共数字账本，它有三个核心特点，去中心化、不可篡改、透明可追溯，想象一个村子里所有人都有一个相同的账本，记录着每笔交易。当发生一笔新交易时，会广播给全村人核对，大家确认无误后，才各自把这条记录写到自己的账本上。这样，任何一个人想偷偷修改自己账本上的记录都是无效的，因为和其他所有人的对不上。这个由大家共同维护、内容一致的账本系统，就类似于区块链。区块链技术最初是作为比特币的底层技术而闻名，但现在其应用已扩展到数字货币、智能合约、供应链管理、数字身份认证等多个领域。
一个完整的区块链系统通常包含以下层次：
1、数据层，最底层，定义区块的链式结构、哈希算法，确保数据不可篡改
2、网络层，采用P2P点对点网络协议，实现节点间的发现、连接和数据广播
3、共识层，核心层，集成共识算法，协调全网节点状态同步
4、合约层，提供智能合约的编程与执行环境，比如以太坊的EVM
5、应用层：面向最终用户的各类去中心化应用DApp，如DeFi、供应链溯源、数字身份
目前全球有几百甚至上千条活跃的链条，其中分为公有链、私有链、联盟链，公有链最为活跃，主要是全球各大投资者和机构在链上进行各种投资和投机的交易，最大的公有链当然是以太坊，用户进行交易有在中心化交易所CEX进行交易的，也有在去中心化DEX直接在链上进行交易的，基于比特币BTC的发展各种代币及金融衍生品层出不穷。
好了，今天就写到这里吧。
