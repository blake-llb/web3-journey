1. Firstly, to engage in blockchain development, numerous websites and resources reside beyond the Great Firewall, necessitating network configuration for access. For instance, configuring Metamask for Chrome requires bypassing the firewall via a browser extension to access Google. Currently configured with the Ji Fengyun VPN service, it synchronises subscription links through the v2rayN VPN tool, supporting real-time updates without manual configuration changes for accessing resources beyond the firewall.
2. Select a blockchain wallet. Metamask is an open-source browser extension wallet primarily used for managing cryptocurrencies and interacting with DApps within the Ethereum ecosystem. Begin by selecting the Sepolia test network for interactions. Sepolia is a test environment network requiring no real funds for operations. First, obtain Sepolia test network tokens (ETH tokens). There are several methods to claim these: verify your GitHub profile via the official faucet at http://faucets.chain.link/sepolia, claim through infrastructure providers or third-party faucet websites by retweeting, or obtain ETH rewards by performing computational tasks on PoW-based faucet sites like sepolia-faucet.pk910.de. I opted for the PoW method as it yields a slightly larger amount of test tokens. Other approaches include cross-chain transfers: if you hold ETH on other layer-2 testnets (such as Arbitrum or Optimism), you may convert it to Sepolia ETH via testnet bridges like testnetbridge.com.
3. Develop a front-end application that connects to an existing Metamask wallet. Key functionalities include linking the wallet to display balances and addresses, utilising the popular Web3 framework Wagmi.
